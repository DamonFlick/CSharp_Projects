 Here is a collection of projects I've done with C# and the .NET Framework/CORE
 
<strong>Projects:</strong>

- Car Insurance
- Package Express

<strong>Car Insurance </strong>

This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes in user input on policy information and calculates a quote base on business logic as the data is stored in a database. There is also an admin view that displays all issued quotes to staff. 

<strong> Package Express </strong>

This is a concole application that calculates shipping costs based on size and weight. This demonstrates buisness logic and exception handling outside of the seatbelt of a framework.
